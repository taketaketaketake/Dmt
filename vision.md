# Vision

## Why this exists

Detroit has builders — software engineers, AI practitioners, hardware makers, founders — but no trusted, local record of who they are or what they're working on. Existing platforms optimize for self-promotion, recruiting noise, and engagement metrics. The signal gets buried.

Detroit Builders Directory is a curated archive that answers three questions:

1. Who is building here
2. What they are working on
3. How to reach them

It exists to make real work visible and findable, without the noise.

## What this is

A community artifact. A reference layer. A field manual of people and projects in Detroit, maintained by humans, not algorithms.

It should feel closer to a well-edited publication than a tech product.

## What this is not

- Not a social network. No feeds, no likes, no public follower counts.
- Not a messaging platform. Contact happens externally.
- Not a growth product. No virality mechanics, no gamification, no engagement loops.
- Not a generic job board. Jobs are tied to verified members with active subscriptions.
- Not a SaaS product. This is a community tool, not a business model.
- Not a seed market. Detroit first, Detroit always.

## Core principles

**Human curation over automation.** Every profile is manually reviewed by an admin before it goes live. Trust is enforced by people, not systems.

**Signal over noise.** The directory is members-only. Browsing requires approval. This keeps the quality bar high and the content meaningful.

**People and projects are first-class.** The system is organized around who's building and what they're building — not around engagement or content production.

**External contact only.** No DMs, no inboxes, no notifications. Members link to their own websites, GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter. The directory points; it doesn't intermediate.

**Durable over trendy.** The design, architecture, and product decisions favor longevity. This should age well and work the same way in five years.

**Simple architecture.** A lightweight monolith. No microservices, no GraphQL, no framework churn. Complexity is the enemy of operability.

## Design bias

- Editorial, not corporate
- Archival, not ephemeral
- Dense but readable, not padded
- Calm authority, not urgency
- Deliberately slow, not optimized for speed-to-engagement

The aesthetic is dark ink and light paper. Hard square portrait crops. Strong typography. No emojis. No rounded avatars. No generic SaaS patterns.

The product should feel like something worth keeping, not something competing for attention.
